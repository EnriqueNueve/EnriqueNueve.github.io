This is week three of re-writing a proof from Axler's book Measure, Integration & Real Analysis by Sheldon Axler. The proof covered here demonstrates the closed form for integral of simple function. 


**Def. ($$\mathcal{S}$$-Partion)**: 

**Def. (Lower Lebesgue Sum)**: 

**Def. (Integral of a Nonnegative Function)**: 

**Integral of a Simple Function**: Suppose $$(X,\mathcal{S},\mu )$$ is a measure space, 
$$E_1,\dots ,E_n$$
are disjoint sets in $$\mathcal{S}$$, and
$$c_1,\dots ,c_n\in [0,\infty ]$$.
Then $$\int ( \sum_{k=1}^{n}c_k\chi_{E_k})d\mu = \sum_{k=1}^{n}c_k \mu (E_k) ~.$$

**Proof**: 
$$\square$$
