This is week two of re-writing a proof from Axler's book Measure, Integration & Real Analysis by Sheldon Axler. The proof covered here is Egorov's Theorem. 

**Lemma 1**: 

**Lemma 2**: 

**Def. (Pointwise Convergence)**: Sequence $$f_1,f_2,\dots $$ converges pointwise on $$X$$ to $$f$$ if $$\lim_{k\to\infty}f_{k}(x)=f(x)$$ for each $$x\in X$$. In other words, $$f_1,f_2,\dots $$ converges pointwise on $$X$$ to $$f$$ if for each $$x\in X$$ and every $$\epsilon >0$$, there exists $$n\in\mathbb{Z}_{+}$$ such that $$|f_{k}(x)-f(x)|<\epsilon $$ for all integers $k\geq n$$ and all $$x\in X$$. 

**Def. (Uniform Convergence)**: Sequence $$f_1,f_2,\dots $$ converges uniformly on $$X$$ to $$f$$ if for every $$\epsilon >0 $$, there exists $$n\in\mathbb{Z}_{+}$$ such that $$|f_{k}(x)-f(x)|<\epsilon $$ for all integers $$k\geq n$$ and all $$x\in X$$. 

**Egorov's Theorem**: suppose $$(X,\mathcal{S},\mu )$$ is a measure space with $$\mu (X)<\infity $$. Suppose $$f_1,f_2,\dots $$ is a sequence 
of $$\mathcal{S}$$-measurable functions from $$X$$ to $$\mathcal{R}$$ that converge pointwise on $$X$$ to a function $$f:X\to\mathcal{R}$$. 
Then for every $$\epsilon > 0 $$, there exists aa set $$E\in\mathcal{S}$$ such that $$\mu (X\setminus E)<\epsilon$$ and $$f_1,f_2,\dots $$ converges
uniformly to $$f$$ on $$E$$. 

**Proof**:
