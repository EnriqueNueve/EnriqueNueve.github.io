This is week four of re-writing a proof from the book Measure, Integration & Real Analysis by Sheldon Axler. The proof covered here demonstrates the Monotone Convergence Theorem. 

**Lemma 1**: 
$$ \int f d\mu = \sup \{ \sum_{j=1}^{m} \mu (A_j ):A_1,\dots ,A_m \text{ are disjoint sets in } \mathcal{S}, c_1,\dots ,c_m \in [0,\infty ], f(x)\geq \sum_{j=1}^{m}c_j \chi_{A_j} \; \forall \; x\in X   \} $$

**Lemma 2**: 
Suppose $$(X,\mathcal{S},\mu )$$ is a measure space and 
$$E_1\subseteq E_2\subseteq \dots  $$ is an increasing sequence
in $$\mathcal{S}$$, then  $$\mu (\cup_{k=1}^{\infty} E_k ) = \lim_{k\to \infty}\mu (E_k)$$.

**Monotone Convergence Theorem**: Suppose $$(X,\mathcal{S},\mu )$$ is a measure space and 
$$0\leq f_1 \leq f_2 \leq \dots $$ is 
an increasing sequence of $$\mathcal{S}$$-measurable functions. 
Define $$f:X\to [0,1]$$ by 
$$f(x)=\lim_{k\to \infty} f_k (x)$$. 
Then 
$$\lim_{k\to \infty}\int f_k d\mu = \int fd\mu $$.

**Proof**: 
$$(\lim_{k\to \infty}\int f_k d\mu \leq \int f d\mu  ): $$ note that since each 
$$f_i$$ is 
$$\mathcal{S}$$-measurable its holds that 
$$f$$ is 
$$\mathcal{S}$$-measurable.
Furtheremore, since $$f_k(x)\leq f(x)$$ for every 
$$x\in X$$, we have that 
$$\int f_k(x)d\mu \leq \int fd\mu$$ for each 
$$k\in \mathbb{Z}_{+}$$.
Hence, we have that 
$$\lim_{k\to \infty}\int f_k d\mu \leq \int f d\mu  $$. 

$$(\lim_{k\to \infty}\int f_k d\mu \geq \int f d\mu  ):$$ suppose 
$$A_1,\dots ,A_m$$ are disjoint sets in $$\mathcal{S}$$ and 
$$c_1,\dots ,c_m \in  [0,\infty ]$$ such that 
$$f(x)\geq \sum_{j=1}^{m}c_j\chi_{A_j}(x)$$ for every 
$$x\in X$$.
Essentiaally, the choosen set $$A_1,\dots ,A_m$$ are used to define a simple function which lower bounds 
$$f$$. 
Let $$t\in (0,1)$$.
For 
$$k\in \mathbb{Z}_{+}$$, let 
$$E_k =\{ x\in X\mid f_k(x)\geq t\sum_{j=1}^{m} c_j \chi_{A_j}(x)  \} $$ (Eq. 1).
By construction, 
$$E_1\subseteq E_2\subseteq \dots $$ is an increasing sequence of sets in 
$$\mathcal{S}$$ whose union equals 
$$X$$.
Note, Lemma 2 applies and we have 
$$\lim_{k\to \infty}\mu (A_j\cap E_k)=\mu (A_j)$$ for each 
$$j\in \{1,\dots ,m \}$$.
Thus, by Lemma 3 we have that
$$\int f_k d\mu \leq t\sum_{j=1}^{m}c_j \mu (A_j\cap E_k)$$.
By taking the lmit as $$k\to \infty$$ and 
$$t\to 1$$, we get 
$$\lim_{k\to \infty}\int f_kd\mu \geq \sum_{j=1}^{m}c_j \mu (A_j)$$.
As 
$$A_1,\dots ,A_m$$ was arbitrarly declared, let 
$$A_1,\dots ,A_m$$  be the sup 
$$\mathcal{S}$$-partion of $$X$$ and all 
$$c_1,\dots c_m\in [0,\infty]$$ satisfying Eq 1.
Finally, by Lemma 1, we get 
$$\lim_{k\to \infty}\int f_k d\mu \geq \int f d\mu $$
completing the proof.
$$\square$$
