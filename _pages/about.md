Currently, I am a fifth-year Ph.D. student in the CS Theory group at CU Boulder, as advised by Bo Waggoner and Rafael Frongillo.
My primary research interests are theoretical machine learning and algorithmic economics. Since starting PhD, I have
conducted research in Elicitation, Loss Function Design, and Prediction Markets.

Although starting my journey as a PhD student in a theory group, I previously
worked in an applied role as an ML Engineer at Argonne National Laboratory within an
Edge Computing group. Performed RD for a variety of ML tasks specialized for use over
an edge network such as model monitoring (out of distribution detection,
outlier detection and active learning, interpretability), model optimization
(quantization), and ML application development, mostly in the domains of audio and image processing.

During my Ph.D. from 2022 to 2025, I worked as a data scientist for the Federal Reserve Bank in Chicago.
Within my role, I primarily developed models to identify different potential risk factors within the banking sector and NLP solutions to assist with the examination process of banks.

From May to December 2025, I am taking a leave of absence to do an ML-related internship with Apple. I will be returning
to CU Boulder in Spring 2026 to defend my thesis and graduate.
